layout: page

# title: Page # put the page title here
# if you want to leave this template markdown file here but don't want the page to show up, simply comment out the title. (The template won't render pages without titles, although you'll still be able to reach this template by entering http://[username].github.io/page into the browser.)

# permalink: /page/
# put the permalink here; as written, the url for this page would be http://[username].github.io/page/
# if you omit the permalink field, the url will simply be the name of the file (page.md becomes /page, which is effectively equivalent to what's in the permalink field above)

To add a page, simply copy this file and update the title and link. (Make sure the ```layout``` remains ```page```.)
